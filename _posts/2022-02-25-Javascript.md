# Introduction
Today was busy Golf code and switch statements.

# Body
Code Golf refers to attempting a problem to solve using the least amount of characters possible.
It tests your ability to reduce, recycle, and reuse for the purpose of achieving the tiniest footprint possible.
We have switch statements.We use switch statements if we have many options to choose from.Switch statement tests a value,it can have many case statements which define many possible values.
We also have a default option in a switch statement,which is similar to a final else statement in an if/else chain.
A default statement will be executed if there are matching case statement foud.
We can have multiple inputs with the same output in a switch statement.
e.g let result = "";
switch(val) {
  case 1:
  case 2:
  case 3:
    result = "1, 2, or 3";
    break;
  case 4:
    result = "4 alone";
}
If we have many options to choose from we can use switch statement instead of writing many chained if/else if statements.

# Conclusion
I am going to continue with Javascript and go back to the golf code part because as much as I was able to do the challenge it is till a challenge.I am also planing on watching some you tube tutorials for better understanding.
