# Introduction
Today I was busy with React and I also did few challenges in javascript

# Body 

In JavaScript, you can also perform calculations with decimal numbers, just like whole numbers.
e.g const product = 2.0 * 2.5;

We can also devide one decimal by another.
e.g const quotient = 4.4 * 2.0;

Finding a remainder in javascript,the remainder operator % gives the remainder of the division of two numbers
e.g 5 % 2 = 1 because
Math.floor(5 / 2) = 2 (Quotient)
2 * 2 = 4
5 - 4 = 1 (Remainder)

or const remainder = 11 % 3;  

With React, we can render this JSX directly to the HTML DOM using React's rendering API known as ReactDOM.

ReactDOM offers a simple method to render React elements to the DOM which looks like this: ReactDOM.render(componentToRender, targetNode)
e.g ReactDOM.render(JSX,document.getElementById('challlenge-node');

I also some projects that I am currently busy with:

1)React

2)Javascript

3)Responsive web assessment

# Conclusion
I am going to continue with React,javascript and my projects.
