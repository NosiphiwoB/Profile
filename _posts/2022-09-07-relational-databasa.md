# Introduction
Today I started with relational database.

# Body
In this course we use developers tools and software including vs code to build projects.The first project that I was busy with was Learn Bash by Building a Boilerplate.I haven't finished the project but with what I have done for now they basically teaching us about terminal.I've learnt few commands :

mkdir <folder_name> ---stands for make directory

pwd ---- The pwd command stands for print working directory

cd ---change directory

ls --- list

more <folder_name> --- more command is used to view the text files in the command prompt, displaying one screen at a time in case the file is large

echo command --- lets you print anything to the terminal

touch <filename> --- can be used to create a new file

cp <file> <destination> ---is used to copy a file

rm <file> ----removes a file

mv <filename> <new_filename> ---can be used to rename or to move something

To clear the terminal we use clear


# Conclusion
I am going to continue with relational database.
