# Introduction
Today I was busy with javascript practise,we also had a workshop with HRW based on E-mail etiquette.

# Body
We had a very informative workshop with HRW.They tought us about the do's and don't when writing a email:

* Subect line - Tells what an email is about, for an example if you are sending a project update, you can have subject line " Update on a project A".

* Salutation - Word or phrase used for greeting a recipient, for an example you can say "Allow me to introduce myself" or "Good afternoon" .

* Body - Main message.

  Tips - Avoid long sentences

       -Be aware of grammar

       -Use paragraphs to sepetate different  topics.

* Signature - The closing, you can use "kind regards"

I also watched youtube tutorial (javascript crash course) .

# Conclusion
I am going to continue with freecode camp and do my javascript projects at the same time because I don't want to be way behind .
