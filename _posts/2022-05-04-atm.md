# Introduction
Today I was still busy with the ATM project that we had to create using html and javascript.

# Body
Today we had to add local storage on the atm project which I did,so I am currently having issues when it comes to setting the atm to not allowing the person to register with the email address that has been register already.I also had a session with the other new students and they helped me with javascript which is what i am currently strugging with,so with what we have done so far I can say I now have an understanding of what needs to be.We discussed the following:

<h4>1)function-I was givin a task to write a function that will return Hello Noxolo</h4>

let word = "Noxolo";

fuction greet(){

    return "Hello " + word;

}

console.log(greet())   ----> console will return Hello Noxolo

or 

function greet(a){

  return a + "Noxolo";

}

console.log(greet("Hello ")) ----> console will return Hello Noxolo

<h4>2)We also discussed replacing method</h4>
e.g const text = "I love drinking cold coffee";

   const newText = text.replace("cold","hot");

console.log(newText) ----> console will return I love drinking hot coffee

<h4>3)We also discussed replacing in an array</h4>
We were not to use a replace method in an array so we had to do a for loop
e.g
const students = ["Mondli","Akhona","Feydo","Njabulo","Khathu"];

const newStudents = (a) => {

    for(let i = 0; i < a.lenght; i++){

        if(a[i] === "Njabulo"){

            a[i] = "Noxolo";

        }

    }

return a;

}

console.log(newStudents(student)); ----> console will return ["Mondli","Akhona","Feydo","Noxolo","Khathu"]

<h4>4)Adding two numbers</h4>
let a = 20;

let b = 14;

function sum(){

    return a + b;

}

console.log(sum()); ----> console will return 34

or 
function sum(a, b) {

    return a + b;

}

console.log(sum(20,14));  ----> will also return 34


# Conclusion
I will continue with a project and also with the sessions that I am doing with the other 4 new students.As soon as I am done with the project I will continue with freecode camp
