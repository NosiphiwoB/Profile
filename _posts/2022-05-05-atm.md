# Introduction
Today I was still busy with the atm project and the javascript tutorials.


# Body
I was busy with atm project, so this is what I have so far : https://nosiphiwob.github.io/ATM/. We also had a javascript tutorial,we discussed javascript methods :

<h5>-Push()</h5>
Push method adds an item at the end of an array :

let students = ["Noxolo","Akhona","Mondli","Khathu","Feydo"];
let newStudents = students.push("Njabulo")
console.log(students) ---> will return ["Noxolo","Akhona","Mondli","Khathu","Feydo","Njabulo"]


<h5>-unshift()</h5>
unshift method adds an item at the beginning of an array:

let students = ["Noxolo","Akhona","Mondli","Khathu","Feydo"];
let newStudents = students.unshift("Njabulo")
console.log(students) ---> will return ["Njabulo","Noxolo","Akhona","Mondli","Khathu","Feydo"]


<h5>-pop()</h5>
pop method removes/deletes an item at the end of an array:

let students = ["Noxolo","Akhona","Mondli","Khathu","Feydo"];
let newStudents = stundents.pop()
console.log(students) ---> will return ["Noxolo","Akhona","Mondli","Khathu"]


<h5>-shift</5>
shift method removes/deletes an item at the beginning of an array:

let students = ["Noxolo","Akhona","Mondli","Khathu","Feydo"];
let newStudents = students.shift()
console.log(students) ---> will return ["Akhona","Mondli","Khathu","Feydo"]


<h5>indexOf</h5>
indexOf method find/returns an index of an item in an array,if the item is not found it returns -1:

let students = ["Noxolo","Akhona","Mondli","Khathu","Feydo"];
let newStudents = students.indexOf("Mondli")
console.log(newStudents) ---> will return 2

let students = ["Noxolo","Akhona","Mondli","Khathu","Feydo"];
let newStudents = students.indexOf("Njabulo")
console.log(newStudents) --->will return -1 because "Njabulo" is not found in our array

# Conclusion
So far I don't have any problems with what we have done,I find the tutorials very helpful.
