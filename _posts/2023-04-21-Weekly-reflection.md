This week I was till busy with PL-200


This week I managed to :

- I also watched PL-200 youtube tutorials.

- Prepare for the PL200 exam using the MeasureUp practise test.

- I was not able to do PL200 tasks on the Labs,it seems like I have lost all my work and have to redo everything.


Next week I want to prepare for my second exam :

- I am going to continue with the practise test.

- I am going to redo the labs.


As much I can see the score increase on the practise test,I still wouldn't be able to explain to someone else what is going on.
