# Introduction
Today I was busy with the react test Njabulo gave us .

# Body 
We were advised to creat a form using react,the form should have:

1) Name

2) Surname

3) Age

4) Two radio buttons

5) A submit button

We were also advised to add css and we were not allowed to use internet.

This is what I manage to do :

# Conclusion
This was helpful because were able to see where we are lacking since we were not using internet.
