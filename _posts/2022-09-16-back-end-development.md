# Introduction
Today I started with back end development and apis.We also had a workshop with HRW .

# Body
I didn't do much on back end development because I was struggling to use the Replit starter project which I need to complete the challenges,github was also giving issues.I only managed to do one challenge .We also had a workshop with HRW (Intro to the working world).The workshop was very helpful,we were taught about the 4IR which is â€œA fusion of advances in artificial intelligence (AI),robotics, the Internet of Things (IoT), genetic engineering, quantum computing.From that I realised that we need to give it our all and learn software development because looking at how things are,we need more devolopers.We were also taught how to find out what you want to do career wise: You need to know your strengths and skills,your interests, and your values in your career.

# Conclusion
I am going to continue with back end development
