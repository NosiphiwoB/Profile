# Introduction
Today I was busy with the react form test.

# Body 
We were given a project to create a react form.A form must have two inputs (name and surname),a submit button.When you submit your form it must appear in a list below the table .You should be able to delete the input.This is what I managed to do : https://github.com/NosiphiwoB/react-form-test/tree/main/src . We also had a meeting with Tannile and Moral.

# Conclusion
I have decided to go back to javascript and do some projects because I am still struggling.I thing I have spent more time tryiong to push freecodecamp forgeting the fact that I have to do things practically.
