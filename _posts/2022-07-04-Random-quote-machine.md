# Introduction
Today I started with the Front End Development Libraries projects.

# Body
Today I was busy with a Random Qoute Machine.I did not have any issues doing it.For now I just did a the basic requirements because I want to finish the other 4 projects before I go back and add few quotes and also style it.On this project we can use any mix of HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Bootstrap, SASS, React, Redux, and jQuery to complete this project. You should use a frontend framework (like React for example) because this section is about learning frontend frameworks. Additional technologies not listed above are not recommended and using them is at your own risk.So far this is what I have : https://codepen.io/NOSIPHIWO/pen/abYvvqE

# Conclusion
I am going to continue with the remaining projects.
