# Introduction
I am still busy with relational database.

# Body
Today there was just a continuation of the project I was busy with.There were few new commands that I learnt :

find--- we can use find to find things or to view a file tree.

mkdir client/<new_folder_name> --- will create a folder inside of the client folder

You cab flag -name  and use it to search for something with find -name <filename> 

The reason I didn't do much was because of the network,it's was very.

# Conclusion
I have decided to move on to back end development and apis.
