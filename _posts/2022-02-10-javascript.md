# Introduction
Today was still busy with Java Script

# Body

## What I learnt today

I learnt that in Java Script we have variables.
variable are used to store the data value that can be changed later on.
We can assign values to the variables using the assignment operator (=).
We can also Declare String Variables using double quotes, let and const.
We can increment or add one to a variable with the ++ operator
We can also decrement.
We also use decimal numbers

# Conclusion

I am going to continue with Java script.
