# Introduction
Today we had a session with Tumisang,we discussed javascript methods.

# Body
We were not able to discuss all the methods due to time,but just to name the few that we discussed: 


1)push() - push method adds an item at the end of an array

e.g cont list = ['juice','sweets','chips','meat','rice','milk'];

    let newList = list.push('sugar')

    console.log(list) ----> will return an array ['juice','sweets','chips','meat','rice','milk','sugar']


2)unshift() - unshift method adds an item at the beginning of an array

e.g const list = ['juice','sweets','chips','meat','rice','milk'];

    let newList = list.unshift('sugar')

    console.log(list) ----> will return an array ['sugar','juice','sweets','chips','meat','rice','milk'];

3)pop()
4)shift()
sort()
