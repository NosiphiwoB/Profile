# Introduction
Today I was busy the if/else statements



# Body
In Javascipt we have else statement
Else statement is an alternative statement that is executed if the result of a previous test condition evaluates to false.
An else statement is used in an if statement as an alternative.
We also have an else if statement  .An else if statement is used when you have multiple condotions that needs to be addressed.So you basically use the else if statement to chain the if statements.
eg. if (num > 15) {
  return "Bigger than 15";
} else if (num < 5) {
  return "Smaller than 5";
} else {
  return "Between 5 and 15";
}
It is very important to place your if and if else statement in a correct order so that you can get the correct outputs.
The if statements are evaluated in order until one of the if expressions is true or the end of the if/else if chain is reached. If the end of the if/else if chain is reached without a true expression, no code blocks are executed.
We can chain together  if/else statements for complex logic
eg.  if (condition1) {
  statement1
} else if (condition2) {
  statement2
} else if (condition3) {
  statement3
. . .
} else {
  statementN
}


# Conclusion
So far I don't have any problems in regards to the gif/else statements.So  I am going to continue with Javascript any also try doing some small projects.
