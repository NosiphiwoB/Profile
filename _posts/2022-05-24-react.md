# Introduction
Today I was busy with react

# Body
The last challenge demonstrated how to pass information from a parent component to a child component as props or properties. This challenge looks at how arrays can be passed as props. To pass an array to a JSX element, it must be treated as JavaScript and wrapped in curly braces.

`<ParentComponent>`

  `<ChildComponent colors={["green", "blue", "red"]} />`

`</ParentComponent>`

The child component then has access to the array property colors. Array methods such as join() can be used when accessing the property. const ChildComponent = (props) => `<p>{props.colors.join(', ')}</p>` This will join all colors array items into a comma separated string and produce: `<p>green, blue, red</p>` Later, we will learn about other common methods to render arrays of data in React.

e.g There are List and ToDo components in the code editor. When rendering each List from the ToDo component, pass in a tasks property assigned to an array of to-do tasks, for example ["walk dog", "workout"]. Then access this tasks array in the List component, showing its value within the p element. Use join(", ") to display the props.tasksarray in the p element as a comma separated list. Today's list should have at least 2 tasks and tomorrow's should have at least 3 tasks:

const List = (props) => {

  { /* Change code below this line */ }

  return `<p>{props.tasks.join(", ")}</p>`

  { /* Change code above this line */ }
};

class ToDo extends React.Component {

  constructor(props) {

    super(props);

  }
  render() {

    return (

      <div>

        `<h1>To Do Lists</h1>`

        `<h2>Today</h2>`

        { /* Change code below this line */ }

        `<List tasks={["Walk", "Cook", "Bake"]}/>`

        `<h2>Tomorrow</h2>`

        `<List tasks={["Study", "Code", "Eat"]}/>`

        { /* Change code above this line */ }

      </div>
    );
  }
};

You can assign default props to a component as a property on the component itself and React assigns the default prop if necessary. This allows you to specify what a prop value should be if no value is explicitly provided. For example, if you declare MyComponent.defaultProps = { location: 'San Francisco' }, you have defined a location prop that's set to the string San Francisco, unless you specify otherwise. React assigns default props if props are undefined, but if you pass null as the value for a prop, it will remain null. 

The way to override the default props is to explicitly set the prop values for a component.
e.g
 const Items = (props) => {

  return `<h1>Current Quantity of Items in Cart: {props.quantity}</h1>`
}

Items.defaultProps = {

  quantity: 0

}

class ShoppingCart extends React.Component {

  constructor(props) {

    super(props);

  }
  render() {

    { /* Change code below this line */ }

    return <Items quantity={10}/>

    { /* Change code above this line */ }

  }
};

# Conclusion
I am going to continue with react and javascript.
