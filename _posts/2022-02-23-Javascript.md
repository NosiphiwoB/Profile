# Introduction
Today I continued with Java Script Algorithms and Data Structure.

# Body
I have learnt that we can assign with a return value,meaning that we can take the return value and assign it to a variable.
We have an abstract Data Structure called queue which is used to keep items in order.The old items will be taken off from the front of the quey and the new items will be add at the back of the queu.
we also have boolen values (true or false),we dont use  qoutes when writting  boolean  values.
We also have if statement and they used to make decision in code,it tells Javascript to execute the code in the curly braces under certain condition (boolean).If the condition is true  it executes the statement inside the curly braces,if it is false the statement inside  will not execute.
We can compare two values using different comparison operators.
Comparison with equality opearator (==),it compares two values and return true if equal and false if not.It can also attempt to convert both values being compared to a common type.
Comparison with strict equality opearator (===),the strict equality operator doe snot perfom a type conversion.If the value shave different types it wiil return false.
Comparison with greater than operator,this can also convert data type of values wile comparing.It is used to compare values of two numbers.
We can also compare with Greater Than Operator or equals to operator,less than operator,less than or equals to operator.
Comparison with the logical and operator,it used when you need to test more than one thing at a time eg. if(num > 6 && num <9).
We can also use logical or comparison

# Conclusion
I am still struggling in few areas but working on them.I will continue with Javascript and also looking forwad to doing some projects based on Javascipt so that I can get a better understanding.
