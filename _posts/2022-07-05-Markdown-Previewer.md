# Introduction
Today I was busy with the second project (Markdown Previewer) on Front End Libriries.

# Body
I had difficulties doing this projects.When I enter text into the #editor element, the #preview element is not updated as I type to display the content of the textarea.I did try to google and also watched some youtube videos but I was not able to do it.I am going to continue trying.So far this is what  I have : https://codepen.io/NOSIPHIWO/pen/JjLYZgE . I am still going to add some few things and also add some styling.

# Consclusion
I am going to continue with the remaining projects.
