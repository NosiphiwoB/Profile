# Introduction
Today I was still busy with the react registration form.

# Body
Today I was able to add the input to the table.I also managed to add the delete button.I was struggling with the delete button.If I had ten items in a table and try to delete only one item,the delete button was deleting all the items in the table.I managed to fix it by adding Uuid v4 which is a React library or package that creates a universally unique identifier (UUID).I used the Uuid v4 to delete item by id.

# Conclusion
I am going to finish this project tomorrow.I will be adding styling.
