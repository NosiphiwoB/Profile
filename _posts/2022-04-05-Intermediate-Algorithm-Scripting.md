# Introduction
Today  I  was  busy  with  the  remaining  challenges  in  Intermediate  Algorithm  Scripting.

# Body
I  did  manage  to  finish  the  remaining  challenges  in  this  course.In  this  course  we  basically  had  to  apply  what  we  have  learnt  in  the  previouse  courses.

I also did few kata's in code wars:
e.g

1. Complete the solution so that it reverses the string passed into it

function solution(str){

return str = str.split('').reverse().join('');
  
}.


2. Implement a function which multiplies two numbers.

const multiply = (num1, num2) => {

  return num1 * num2;

};

console.log(multiply(2,5));


3.Given a non-negative integer, 3 for example, return a string with a murmur: "1 sheep...2 sheep...3 sheep...". Input will always be valid, i.e. no negative integers.

var countSheep = function (num){

  let str = "";

  for(let i = 1; i <= num; i++){ 

    str += `${i} sheep...`; };

  return str;

}.

I also started with some JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects

# Conclusion
I am almost done with javascript. I am going to the last four projects and move on to the next courses.
