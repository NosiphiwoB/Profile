# Introduction
I am still busy with Javascript.

# Body
I learnt that in Javascript we are able to devide our code into reusable parts which are called functions.
we have something called parameters,they are variables that acts as palaceholders that can bew called later on.
We can pass values with arguments and return values with return.
We have variables that can be seen everywhere in Js code and we refer to them as Global scope.
WE also have Local scope which can only be seen within the function.
We can have both variables (global and local) with the same name,but when you do that the local variable outweighs the global variable.

# Conclusion
I will continue with JS and start with the project that was given to us (creating an RSVP form using html and css) .
