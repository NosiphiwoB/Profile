# Introduction
 Today I was busy with the remaining challenges on react and redux.

 # Body
 Now that you understand how to use connect to connect React to Redux, you can apply what you've learned to your React component that handles messages.In the last lesson, the component you connected to Redux was named Presentational, and this wasn't arbitrary. This term generally refers to React components that are not directly connected to Redux. They are simply responsible for the presentation of UI and do this as a function of the props they receive. By contrast, container components are connected to Redux. These are typically responsible for dispatching actions to the store and often pass store state to child components as props.

e.g The code editor has all the code you've written in this section so far. The only change is that the React component is renamed to Presentational. Create a new component held in a constant called Container that uses connect to connect the Presentational component to Redux. Then, in the AppWrapper, render the React Redux Provider component. Pass Provider the Redux store as a prop and render Container as a child. Once everything is setup, you will see the messages app rendered to the page again:

// Redux:
const ADD = 'ADD';

const addMessage = (message) => {
  return {
    type: ADD,
    message: message
  }
};

const messageReducer = (state = [], action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case ADD:
      return [
        ...state,
        action.message
      ];
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

const store = Redux.createStore(messageReducer);

// React:
class Presentational extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      input: '',
      messages: []
    }
    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
    this.submitMessage = this.submitMessage.bind(this);
  }
  handleChange(event) {
    this.setState({
      input: event.target.value
    });
  }
  submitMessage() {
    this.setState((state) => {
      const currentMessage = state.input;
      return {
        input: '',
        messages: state.messages.concat(currentMessage)
      };
    });
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h2>Type in a new Message:</h2>
        <input
          value={this.state.input}
          onChange={this.handleChange}/><br/>
        <button onClick={this.submitMessage}>Submit</button>
        <ul>
          {this.state.messages.map( (message, idx) => {
              return (
                 <li key={idx}>{message}</li>
              )
            })
          }
        </ul>
      </div>
    );
  }
};

// React-Redux:
const mapStateToProps = (state) => {
  return { messages: state }
};

const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => {
  return {
    submitNewMessage: (newMessage) => {
       dispatch(addMessage(newMessage))
    }
  }
};

const Provider = ReactRedux.Provider;
const connect = ReactRedux.connect;

// Define the Container component here:
const Container = connect(mapStateToProps,mapDispatchToProps)(Presentational)

class AppWrapper extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  render() {
    // Complete the return statement:
    return (
      <Provider store={store}>
      <Container/>
      </Provider>
    );
  }
};


Extract local state into Redux:In the Presentational component, first, remove the messages property in the local state. These messages will be managed by Redux. Next, modify the submitMessage() method so that it dispatches submitNewMessage() from this.props, and pass in the current message input from local state as an argument. Because you removed messages from local state, remove the messages property from the call to this.setState() here as well. Finally, modify the render() method so that it maps over the messages received from props rather than state.Once these changes are made, the app will continue to function the same, except Redux manages the state. This example also illustrates how a component may have local state: your component still tracks user input locally in its own state. You can see how Redux provides a useful state management framework on top of React. You achieved the same result using only React's local state at first, and this is usually possible with simple apps. However, as your apps become larger and more complex, so does your state management, and this is the problem Redux solves.

e.g 
// Redux:
const ADD = 'ADD';

const addMessage = (message) => {
  return {
    type: ADD,
    message: message
  }
};

const messageReducer = (state = [], action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case ADD:
      return [
        ...state,
        action.message
      ];
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

const store = Redux.createStore(messageReducer);

// React:
const Provider = ReactRedux.Provider;
const connect = ReactRedux.connect;

// Change code below this line
class Presentational extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  
    this.state = {
      input: ''
    }
    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
    this.submitMessage = this.submitMessage.bind(this);
  }
  handleChange(event) {
    this.setState({
      input: event.target.value
    });
  }
  submitMessage() {
  
    this.props.submitNewMessage(this.state.input);
    this.setState({
      input: ''
    });
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h2>Type in a new Message:</h2>
        <input
          value={this.state.input}
          onChange={this.handleChange}/><br/>
        <button onClick={this.submitMessage}>Submit</button>
        <ul>
      
          {this.props.messages.map( (message, idx) => {
              return (
                 <li key={idx}>{message}</li>
              )
            })
          }
        </ul>
      </div>
    );
  }
};
// Change code above this line

const mapStateToProps = (state) => {
  return {messages: state}
};

const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => {
  return {
    submitNewMessage: (message) => {
      dispatch(addMessage(message))
    }
  }
};

const Container = connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(Presentational);

class AppWrapper extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <Provider store={store}>
        <Container/>
      </Provider>
    );
  }
};

# Conclusion
I managed to finish React and Redux but I don't have a full understanding.For now I am going to do the projects and try watch some youtube tutorials.
