# Introduction
Today I was busy with two projects (Survey Form and Landing Page Projects)

# Body
I had projects that I did on code pen,so today I had to re-do my projects on vs code.What I had to do was to remove and add some few things to my  projects.

The first one was the survey form,this is what I had before ( https://codepen.io/NOSIPHIWO/pen/podbpyM ) after editing this is what I have ( https://nosiphiwob.github.io/Survey-Form/ )


The other project that I was busy with is the product landing page,also had to add and deleting few things in this project as well.This was my project before editing ( https://codepen.io/NOSIPHIWO/pen/YzEpovz ) and this is what I currently have ( https://nosiphiwob.github.io/Product-landing-page/ ). I am not done with the project yet.

# Conclusion 
I am going to continue with my projects and also do some practice on code wars.
