# Introduction
Today I was busy with ES6 and I managed to finish all the challenges on ES6 and I started with Regular Expressions.Today I am only going to talk about the challenges I did on ES6.

# Body
Creating Strings using Template Literals,template literals allows us to create multi line strings and to use string interpolation features to create strings.
 e.g  const result = {
  success: ["max-length", "no-amd", "prefer-arrow-functions"],
  failure: ["no-var", "var-on-top", "linebreak"],
  skipped: ["no-extra-semi", "no-dup-keys"]
};
function makeList(arr) {
  const failureItems = [];
  for(let i=0; i< arr.length; i++) {
  failureItems.push(`<li class="text-warning">${arr[i]}</li>`)

  }

  return failureItems;
}

const failuresList = makeList(result.failure);

Writing Concise Object Literal Declarations Using Object Property Shorthand,we have a getMousePosition function that returns an object containing two properties,instead of writing: const getMousePosition = (x, y) => ({
  x: x,
  y: y
}); 
we can write : const getMousePosition = (x, y) => ({ x, y });
 
Writing Concise Declarative Functions with ES6,in ES5 we had to use the keyword function when defining the function.In ES6 we are able to remove the keyword function  when defining the function 
e.g  const person = {
  name: "Taylor",
  sayHello() {
    return `Hello! My name is ${this.name}.`;
  }
};


Using class Syntax to Define a Constructor Function,

 
Use getters and setters to Control Access to an Object,we have getters and setters that are used to obtain values from an object and set the value of property within an object.
*Getters function returns  the value of an objects private variable to the user without the user directly accessing the private variable.
*Setters function sets the value of an objects privates variable base on the value passed into the setter function.
e.g  class Book {
  constructor(author) {
    this._author = author;
  }
  // getter
  get writer() {
    return this._author;
  }
  // setter
  set writer(updatedAuthor) {
    this._author = updatedAuthor;
  }
}
const novel = new Book('anonymous');
console.log(novel.writer);
novel.writer = 'newAuthor';
console.log(novel.writer);         


Create a Module Script,module script allows us to share code among Javascript files.We can also export and import parts of a file for use in one or more other files.This is an example of how you create a script : <script type="module" src="filename.js"></script>
To share a code block we use export,export allows us to export single or more functions
e.g export const add = (x, y) => {
  return x + y;
}
we export multiple things by repeating the same function for each thing we want to export.
To import the  item we use import 
e.g   import { add } from './math_functions.js';  
To import everything from a file we use (*)
e.g  import * as myMathModule from "./math_functions.js";
We also have a export default syntax,it is usually used if only one value  is being exported from a file e.g  export default function add(x, y) {
  return x + y;
}

export default function(x, y) {
  return x + y;
}

# Conclusion
I am going to continue with Regular Expressions and also do a revision on what I've learnt.
