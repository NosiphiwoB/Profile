# Introduction
Today we had a workshop with HRW,the workshop was about the 7 habit of a highly effective people.

# Body
The workshop was a great success.I learnt a lot from it.We were taught about the 7 habit of a highly effective people:

1) Be proactive - We got lot of example or scenarios we can use to describe a proactive person but what stood out for me was being able to focus on finding solution then focusing or complaining about the situation.

2) Begin with the end in mind - Beginning with the end in mind can motivate you work hard and smart to achieve your goal,having an end goal in mind is a constant reminder for you to complete your mission.

3) Put first things first - You need to organise your things,you need to know your priorities.Know what needs to be done first.

4) Think win/win - Put yourself in other persons shoes,both parts should benefit.

5) Seek first to understand,then to be understood - for an example if you are givin an instruction to do something and you don't listen carefully you might end up making mistakes.

6) Synergize - Be able/willing to work with other people.Recognise the limits of your own understanding and insufficiency of your  experience .

7) Sharpend the saw - give yourself some time to refresh physically,spiritually,mentally, and emotionally.Take walks,listen to music,go to gym.
