# Introduction
Today I started with Front End Development Libraries (bootstrap).

# Body
Bootstrap is a free and open source front end development framework for the creation of websites and web apps. The Bootstrap framework is built on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (JS) to facilitate the development of responsive, mobile-first sites and apps.


Bootstrap can figure out how wide your screen is and respond by resizing your html elements.There is no need to design a mobile version of your website.We can add bootstrap to any app by adding the following code to the top of our html: <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-BVYiiSIFeK1dGmJRAkycuHAHRg32OmUcww7on3RYdg4Va+PmSTsz/K68vbdEjh4u" crossorigin="anonymous"/>
We can set the image to the exactly the width of the phone's screen by adding the class called img-responsive.

We can add the class called "text-center" to our h2 element to center our heading element,we can add several classes in the same element by seperating each of them with spaces.
eg `<h2 class="red-text text-center">your text</h2>` .

We can also create a button using bootstrap,button created with bootstrap looks much better than the plain html ones.Normally, your button elements with the "btn" and "btn-default" classes are only as wide as the text that they contain.Using a block element  with the class of "btn-block" makes the button stretch to fill the pages entire horizontal space and elements following it will flow onto a new line below the block.

Class called "btn-primary" is the main color we use in the app, it is useful for highlighting actions we want our user to take.

The "btn-info" class is used to call attention to optional actions that the user can take

We use the "btn-danger" class  which is the button color that is used to notify users that the button performs a destructive  action,such as deleting a cat photo (wich is used as an example in this case) .

# Conclusion
So far I don't have any have issues with regards to the course that I am currently doing.I am going to continue with the course and also do some practice for a better understanding.
