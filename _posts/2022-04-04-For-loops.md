# Introduction
Today I decided to revisit for loops because when doing the challenges made me realise that I really don't have a clear understanding of how for loops work.

# Body
A for loop is a control flow statement for specifying iteration, which allows code to be executed repeatedly,it is used to repeat a specific block of code a known number of times.
A for loop has 3 statements:

Statement 1-is executed before the execution of the code block (let i = 0;).In statement 1 we can initiate many values and separate them with commas 
e.g for (let i = 0, len = cars.length, text = ""; i < len; i++) {
  text += cars[i] + "<br>";
}.

Statement 2-defines the condition for executing the code block (i < 5;).This statement evaluate the condition of the variable.If statement 2 returns true, the loop will start over again, if it returns false, the loop will end.If you omit statement 2, you must provide a break inside the loop. Otherwise the loop will never end

Statement 3-is executed after the code block has been executed (i++).This statement increments the value of the initial variable.We can do a negative increment (i--).

Here is an example of a for loop:

 for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {

  text += "The number is " + i + "<br>";

}.

# Conclusion
Previously I was not able to write a for loop and also did not know which statement should come and what is that statement for.So going back and giving undivided attention to the for loops helped me a lot.
