# Introduction
Today I was busy with Javascript and also did a project that was given to us.

# Body
We have profile lookup, we able to access objects inside an array using profile lookup
e.g function lookUpProfile(name, prop).
Generate Random Fractions with JavaScript,random numbers helps to create random behavior.We use Math.random() function to generate a random decimal number between 0 and 1.

Generate Random Whole Numbers with JavaScript,we also able to generate random whole numbers.We use the funtion math.floor( ) to round of the number to the nearest whole number.
e.g Math.floor(Math.random() * 20);

We can generate  a random whole number that falls within a range of two specific numbers.We have to define a minimum number (min) and  a maximum number (max).
To generate a random whole number within a range we use this formula: Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1)) + min.

ParseInt Function, this function parses a string and returns a whole number (integer).
e.g const a = parseInt("007");  , this will convert 007 to  7.

We also had a project that we did as a group where by we were supposed to get a sum of a and b
a = "111"
b = "222"

a = 111
b = "222"

const addNumber = (num1 , num2) => {
    
 console.log(typeof parseFloat(num2)) 

return +num1 + Number(num2)
}

console.log(addNumber(a,b))


We also had another project that we had to do indivusualy :
Create a repo on github where you will be completing all your kata's projects.  

Create a function that returns 'Hello, world', if the name is undefined or empty string,
if the name is defined, then return Hello, name.

Below is the link for my Kata project:

# Conclusion
I am onlyleft with 3 challenges on JavaScript Basics then I will move to the next course
