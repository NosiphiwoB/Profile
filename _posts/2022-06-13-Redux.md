# Introduction
Today I was busy with Redux.

# Body
After an action is created and dispatched, the Redux store needs to know how to respond to that action. This is the job of a reducer function. Reducers in Redux are responsible for the state modifications that take place in response to actions. A reducer takes state and action as arguments, and it always returns a new state. It is important to see that this is the only role of the reducer. It has no side effects â€” it never calls an API endpoint and it never has any hidden surprises. The reducer is simply a pure function that takes state and action, then returns new state.Another key principle in Redux is that state is read-only. In other words, the reducer function must always return a new copy of state and never modify state directly. Redux does not enforce state immutability, however, you are responsible for enforcing it in the code of your reducer functions. You'll practice this in later challenges.

e.g
const defaultState = {

  login: false 

};

const reducer = (state = defaultState, action) => {

  // Change code below this line 

if (action.type === "LOGIN") {

    return {   

      login: true    

    };  

  } else {

    return state;

  }

  // Change code above this line  

};

const store = Redux.createStore(reducer);

const loginAction = () => {

  return { 

    type: 'LOGIN'   

  }  

};


You can tell the Redux store how to handle multiple action types. Say you are managing user authentication in your Redux store. You want to have a state representation for when users are logged in and when they are logged out. You represent this with a single state object with the property authenticated. You also need action creators that create actions corresponding to user login and user logout, along with the action objects themselves.
e.g 

const defaultState = {

  authenticated: false

};

const authReducer = (state = defaultState, action) => {

  // Change code below this line

switch (action.type) {

    case "LOGIN":

      return {

        authenticated: true

      };

    case "LOGOUT":

      return {

        authenticated: false

      };

    default:

      return defaultState;

  }

  // Change code above this line

};

const store = Redux.createStore(authReducer);

const loginUser = () => {

  return {

    type: 'LOGIN'

  }

};

const logoutUser = () => {

  return {

    type: 'LOGOUT'

  }

};

A common practice when working with Redux is to assign action types as read-only constants, then reference these constants wherever they are used. You can refactor the code you're working with to write the action types as const declarations.

e.g 
const LOGIN = 'LOGIN';

const LOGOUT = 'LOGOUT';

const defaultState = {

  authenticated: false

};

const authReducer = (state = defaultState, action) => {

  switch (action.type) {

    case LOGIN:

      return {

        authenticated: true

      }

    case LOGOUT:

      return {

        authenticated: false

      }

    default:

      return state;

  }

};

const store = Redux.createStore(authReducer);

const loginUser = () => {

  return {

    type: LOGIN

  }

};

const logoutUser = () => {

  return {

    type: LOGOUT

  }
};

# Conclusion
I will continue with redux I will also check some youtube tutorials.
