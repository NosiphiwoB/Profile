# Introduction
Today was busy with ES6

# Body 
evaluating arrays in-place using the spread operator.We have a spread operator which allows us to expand  arrays and other expressions in place where multiple paramerers or elements are expected.spread operator ( ... ) allows us to quickly copy all or part of an existing array or object into another array or object.

We have Destructuring assignment,wich neatly assign values taken directly from an object
e.g we have this code : const user = { name: 'John Doe', age: 34 };

const name = user.name;
const age = user.age;
We can write it using destructuring assignment  : const { name, age } = user;
The variables will be created and assigned the values of their respective values from the user object.We can  extract as many values from the object as we want.

We can also assign new variable names when extracting values
e.g const user = { name: 'John Doe', age: 34 }; and here is how you can give new variable names : const { name: userName, age: userAge } = user; , "userName" and "userAge" are new variables names. 

Use Destructuring Assignment to Assign Variables from Nested Objects,we can also destructure values from nested objects.
e.g const user = {
  noxyBiy: { 
    age: 28,
    email: 'noxyBiy@gmail.com'
  }
};
here is how you can extract the values of object propertis :
 const {noxyBiy: {age, email}} = user;
 
 We can also use destructuring assignment to assign variables from arrays,when destructuring arrays we can choose which elements we want to asign to variables unlike when using the spread operator which unpacks all content of an array in comma separated list.
 example of destructuring an array : const [a, b] = [1,2,3,4,5,6];      console.log(a,b); will display values of and b as 1,2.
 We can also swap the values of a and b : 
 let a = 8, b =6;
     [a,b] = [b,a];
     

Using Destructuring Assignment with the Rest Parameter to Reassign Array Elements : const [a, b, ...arr] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7];
console.log(a, b);
console.log(arr); .
The console will display values 1, 2 and [3, 4, 5, 7], a and b will get the first two values and arr will take the rest of the values bacause of the rest parameter.

# Conclusion
I am struggling with a challenge where I have to use destructuring assignment to Pass an Object as a Function's Parameters
