# Introduction
Today I was busy with rsvp form

# Body
Today I was busy with a project that was given to us.We had to use Javascript on the rsvp form project that was given to us previously.Below is the email that was sent us :

From the project given by Njabulo (RSVP FORM). On the 'will you attend section', if the user clicks "Yes", the information below appears, and if the user clicks "No", the information disappears. Also, add the submit button. Display the output information on the table/list when the submit button is clicked.

So far this is what I have managed to do : https://github.com/NosiphiwoB/RSVP-Form .

# Conclusion
I going to finish with RSVP from and continue with ES6.
