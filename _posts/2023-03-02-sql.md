# Introduction
This week I was busy with SQL Tables.I learnt the sql commands,creating tables, and connecting tables. 

# Body
Sql is the standard language that deals with Relational Databases.

We have different commands that we use in Sql, below I have a list of few commands that I have used this week :

1> CREATE - We use the create command to create a database or a table.

  e.g CREATE DATABASE student-portal;
   -This will create a database named student-portal.


2>Drop - We use the drop command to delete an existing database or table.
  
  e.g DROP DATABASE student-portal;
   -This will delete the database named student-portal.


3>SELECT - We use select command to fetch from a table.

  e.g SELECT column1, column2
      FROM table-name;
    -This will fetch column1 and column2 data from the table.


4>INSERT ->Creates a record.

  e.g INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3)
    VALUES (value1, value2, value3); 
    -This will return a table with 3 columns and their respective values.
