# Introduction
Today I was busy with react

# Body
As the challenges continue to use more complex compositions with React components and JSX, there is one important point to note. Rendering ES6 style class components within other components is no different than rendering the simple components you used in the last few challenges. You can render JSX elements, stateless functional components, and ES6 class components within other components.
e.g In the code editor, the TypesOfFood component is already rendering a component called Vegetables. Also, there is the Fruits component from the last challenge.

Nest two components inside of Fruits â€” first NonCitrus, and then Citrus. Both of these components are provided for you behind the scenes. Next, nest the Fruits class component into the TypesOfFood component, below the h1 heading element and above Vegetables. The result should be a series of nested components, which uses two different component types:

class Fruits extends React.Component {

  constructor(props) {

    super(props);

  }

  render() {

    return (

      <div>

        `<h2>Fruits:</h2>`

        { /* Change code below this line */ }

         `<NonCitrus/>`

         `<Citrus/>`  

        { /* Change code above this line */ }

      </div>
    );
  }
};

class TypesOfFood extends React.Component {

  constructor(props) {

     super(props);

  }

  render() {

    return (

      <div>

        `<h1>Types of Food:</h1>`

        { /* Change code below this line */ }

         `<Fruits/>`

        { /* Change code above this line */ }

        `<Vegetables />`

      </div>
    );
  }
};

Another feature very common in React: props. In React, you can pass props, or properties, to child components. Say you have an App component which renders a child component called Welcome which is a stateless functional component. You can pass Welcome a user property by writing:

`<App>`

  `<Welcome user='Mark' />`

`</App>`

e.g There are Calendar and CurrentDate components in the code editor. When rendering CurrentDate from the Calendar component, pass in a property of date assigned to the current date from JavaScript's Date object. Then access this prop in the CurrentDate component, showing its value within the p tags. Note that for prop values to be evaluated as JavaScript, they must be enclosed in curly brackets, for instance date={Date()}:

const CurrentDate = (props) => {

  return (

    <div>

      { /* Change code below this line */ }

      `<p>The current date is: {props.date}</p>`

      { /* Change code above this line */ }

    </div>

  );
};

class Calendar extends React.Component {

  constructor(props) {

    super(props);

  }

  render() {

    return (

      <div>

        `<h3>What date is it?</h3>`

        { /* Change code below this line */ }

        `<CurrentDate date={Date()}/>`

        { /* Change code above this line */ }

      </div>
      
    );
  }
};


# Conclusion
So far I don't have any issues with react except that it some how includes javascript which I haven't mastered.So I have to try and do both javascript and react on freecode camp.
