# Introduction
Today I was busy with the ATM project.

# Body 
I didn't get a chance to do freecode camp, we were given a project to create an ATM.
The ATM should have a functioning deposit and withdraw,if we deposit or withdraw it should show the remaining balance on Bal.

So far this is what I have :
