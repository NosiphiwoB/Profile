# Introduction
Today I was busy with my RSVP Form.

# Body
I was ale to finish the RSVP Form project that was given to us.
The instruction was that we must create an rsvp form using html and css with the  following:
Name 
Surname
Date of birth
Cell number
Email address
Radio button (confirming if the person is coming with a partner or not)
Checkbox (food preferences)
Below is a link of my project:

# Conclusion
Before doing this project I was struggling when it comes to radio buttons and checkbox and it helped me a lot to revise what I've learnt before.
Going forwad I will continue with Javascript and typing club.
