<p>The week was okay even though I was not feeling well.</p>
<p> I had a lot of work to do since I didn't attend the Microsoft Power Platform App Make virtual class last week on Monday,</p> 
<p>so I had to start my exercisesÂ this week.</p>



<p>This week I managed to do :</p>

<ul>
<li>- Some of the exercises on Microsoft Power App Maker.</li>
<li>- Work on the Inventory Management System (Created Controllers and Models).</li>
<li>-I created the GET and the POST methods.</li>
</ul>



<p>Next week I want to continue with the Inventory System :</p>


<ul>
<li>- The PUT and DELETE method.</li>
<li>- Start working on the database.</li>
</ul>


<p>For now I am struggling with the PUT method.</p> <p> I need to do more research on that.</p>
