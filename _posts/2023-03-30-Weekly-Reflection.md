The week was okay even though I was not feeling well.
I had a lot of work to do since I didn't attend the Microsoft Power Platform App Make virtual class last week on Monday,
so I had to start my exercisesÂ this week.



This week I managed to do :


 -Some of the exercises on Microsoft Power App Maker.


 -Work on the Inventory Management System (Created Controllers and Models).


 -I created the GET and the POST methods.


Next week I want to continue with the Inventory System :



 -The PUT and DELETE method.


 -Start working on the database.



For now I am struggling with the PUT method. I need to do more research on the PUT method, and also ask for help from others.
