# Introduction
Today I continued with Javascript

# Body
I am still busy with Javascript.
So today I learnt that most programming languages  start counting from zero and that is referred to as zero based indexing.
String values are immutable,meaning that we cannot change the value once created.
We can use thew bracket to find nth character,last character and nth-to-last character in a string.
We can store multiple values in a variable using JS arrays.
We can access and modify array data with indexes.
We can manipulate arrays using pop,shift,unshift and push.
We acn also create a shopping list

# conclusion
Today will be continuing with JS.
