# Introduction
Javascript

# Body
Returning boolean values from functions,previously I learnt that all  comparison operators return  a true or false value.
We can also use an if/else statement to do a comparison.
Return Early Pattern for Functions,there early returns keeps the code visually flatter which makes the code more readable and prevent the function from becoming confusing.
We also have a card counting function.
Javascipt objects,we are able to build objects in javascript.Objects are similar to arrays but to access the data in objects we use properties instead of indexes.objects help storing data in a structured way.
Here is an example of how you can build an object:
const dog = {
  "name": "bobby",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["Water", "Dogs"]
}; 
We are able to access object properties using dot notation and bracket notation
e.g   const myObj = {
  prop1: "val1",
  prop2: "val2"
};

const prop1val = myObj.prop1;
const prop2val = myObj.prop2;  .
Here is an example for bracket notaion: myObj["Space Name"];
myObj['More Space'];
myObj["NoSpace"];.
Accessing Object Properties with Variables,we use bracket notation to access a property which is stored  as a value of a variable.
