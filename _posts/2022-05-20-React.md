# Introduction
Today I was busy with react

# Body 
React provides useful type-checking features to verify that components receive props of the correct type. For example, your application makes an API call to retrieve data that you expect to be in an array, which is then passed to a component as a prop. You can set propTypes on your component to require the data to be of type array. This will throw a useful warning when the data is of any other type.It's considered a best practice to set propTypes when you know the type of a prop ahead of time. You can define a propTypes property for a component in the same way you defined defaultProps. Doing this will check that props of a given key are present with a given type

e.g const Items = (props) => {

  return `<h1>Current Quantity of Items in Cart: {props.quantity}</h1>`

};

// Change code below this line

Items.propTypes = {quantity: PropTypes.number.isRequired}

// Change code above this line

Items.defaultProps = {

  quantity: 0

};

class ShoppingCart extends React.Component {

  constructor(props) {

    super(props);

  }

  render() {

    return `<Items />`

  }
};

The ES6 class component uses a slightly different convention to access props.
Anytime you refer to a class component within itself, you use the this keyword. To access props within a class component, you preface the code that you use to access it with this. For example, if an ES6 class component has a prop called data, you write {this.props.data} in JSX.
e.g Render an instance of the Welcome component in the parent component App. Here, give Welcome a prop of name and assign it a value of a string. Within the child, Welcome, access the name prop within the strong tags:

class App extends React.Component {

  constructor(props) {

    super(props);

  }
  render() {

    return (

        `<div>`

            { /* Change code below this line */ }

            <Welcome name="nosi"/>

            { /* Change code above this line */ }

       `</div>`

    );
  }
};

class Welcome extends React.Component {

  constructor(props) {

    super(props);

  }
  render() {

    return (

        <div>

          { /* Change code below this line */ }

          `<p>Hello, <strong>{this.props.name}</strong>!</p>`

          { /* Change code above this line */ }

        </div>
    );
  }
};


A stateless functional component is any function you write which accepts props and returns JSX. A stateless component, on the other hand, is a class that extends React.Component, but does not use internal state (covered in the next challenge). Finally, a stateful component is a class component that does maintain its own internal state. You may see stateful components referred to simply as components or React components. 


Review Using Props with Stateless Functional Components

class CampSite extends React.Component {

  constructor(props) {

    super(props);

  }
  render() {

    return (

      <div>

        <Camper/>

      </div>
    );
  }
};
// Change code below this line

const Camper=(props) => `<p>{props.name}</p>`

Camper.defaultProps = {name:'CamperBot'};

Camper.propTypes={name:PropTypes.string.isRequired};



# Conclusion
I will continue with freecode camp and also do the projects that I have.
