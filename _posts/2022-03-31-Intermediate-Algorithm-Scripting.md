# Introduction
Today  I started with a new course Intermediate Algorithm Scripting.

# Body
Today I was busy with Intermediate Algorithm Scripting which is very challenging. I spent the whole day trying to solve the challenges.Looking at the challenges my understanding is that we need to apply what we have learnt so , which made me  realise that I still have a lot of work to do.I am planning on watching some youtube courses and  ask for assistances from the seniors.

# Conclusion 
I am going to continue with the Intermediate Algorithm Scripting, which is the last course remaining in Javascript
