# Introduction
I am currently busy with react and the three projects that I have

# Body
State consists of any data your application needs to know about, that can change over time. You want your apps to respond to state changes and present an updated UI when necessary. React offers a nice solution for the state management of modern web applications.You create state in a React component by declaring a state property on the component class in its constructor. This initializes the component with state when it is created. The state property must be set to a JavaScript object. Declaring it looks like this:

this.state = {
}

You must create a class component by extending React.Component in order to create state like this

e.g 

class StatefulComponent extends React.Component {

  constructor(props) {

    super(props);

    // Only change code below this line

this.state={name:'Nosi'}

    // Only change code above this line

  }
  render() {

    return (

      <div>

        `<h1>{this.state.name}</h1>`

      </div>
    );
  }
};

Once you define a component's initial state, you can display any part of it in the UI that is rendered. If a component is stateful, it will always have access to the data in state in its render() method. You can access the data with this.state.If you want to access a state value within the return of the render method, you have to enclose the value in curly braces.state is one of the most powerful features of components in React. It allows you to track important data in your app and render a UI in response to changes in this data. If your data changes, your UI will change. React uses what is called a virtual DOM, to keep track of changes behind the scenes. When state data updates, it triggers a re-render of the components using that data - including child components that received the data as a prop. React updates the actual DOM, but only where necessary. This means you don't have to worry about changing the DOM. You simply declare what the UI should look like.

Note that if you make a component stateful, no other components are aware of its state. Its state is completely encapsulated, or local to that component, unless you pass state data to a child component as props. This notion of encapsulated state is very important because it allows you to write certain logic, then have that logic contained and isolated in one place in your code.
e.g In the code editor, MyComponent is already stateful. Define an h1 tag in the component's render method which renders the value of name from the component's state:

class MyComponent extends React.Component {

  constructor(props) {

    super(props);

    this.state = {

      name: 'freeCodeCamp'

    }
  }
  render() {

    return (

      <div>

        { /* Change code below this line */ }

  `<h1>{this.state.name}</h1>`

        { /* Change code above this line */ }

      </div>
    );
  }
};

There is another way to access state in a component. In the render() method, before the return statement, you can write JavaScript directly. For example, you could declare functions, access data from state or props, perform computations on this data, and so on. Then, you can assign any data to variables, which you have access to in the return statement.

e.g 

class MyComponent extends React.Component {

  constructor(props) {

    super(props);

    this.state = {

      name: 'freeCodeCamp'

    }
  }
  render() {

    // Change code below this line

const name = this.state.name

    // Change code above this line

    return (

      <div>

        { /* Change code below this line */ }

`<h1>{name}</h1>`

        { /* Change code above this line */ }

      </div>
    );
  }
};

# Conclusion
So far I don't have any issues with react,I will continue with react and javascript
