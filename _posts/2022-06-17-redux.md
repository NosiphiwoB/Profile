# Introduction
Today I was busy with redux.I decided to redo all the challenges that I have done so far on redux because I am currently struggling with redux.

# Body
After an action is created and dispatched, the Redux store needs to know how to respond to that action. This is the job of a reducer function. Reducers in Redux are responsible for the state modifications that take place in response to actions. A reducer takes state and action as arguments, and it always returns a new state. It is important to see that this is the only role of the reducer. It has no side effects â€” it never calls an API endpoint and it never has any hidden surprises. The reducer is simply a pure function that takes state and action, then returns new state.Another key principle in Redux is that state is read-only. In other words, the reducer function must always return a new copy of state and never modify state directly. Redux does not enforce state immutability, however, you are responsible for enforcing it in the code of your reducer functions.
e.g
const defaultState = {
  login: false 
};
const reducer = (state = defaultState, action) => {
  // Change code below this line 
if (action.type === "LOGIN") {
    return {   
      login: true      
    };    
  } else {
    return state;
  }
  // Change code above this line  
};
const store = Redux.createStore(reducer);
const loginAction = () => {
  return { 
    type: 'LOGIN'    
  }  
};


You can tell the Redux store how to handle multiple action types. Say you are managing user authentication in your Redux store. You want to have a state representation for when users are logged in and when they are logged out. You represent this with a single state object with the property authenticated. You also need action creators that create actions corresponding to user login and user logout, along with the action objects themselves.
e.g 
const defaultState = {
  authenticated: false
};

const authReducer = (state = defaultState, action) => {
  // Change code below this line
switch (action.type) {
    case "LOGIN":
      return {
        authenticated: true
      };

    case "LOGOUT":
      return {
        authenticated: false
      };

    default:
      return defaultState;
  }
  // Change code above this line
};

const store = Redux.createStore(authReducer);

const loginUser = () => {
  return {
    type: 'LOGIN'
  }
};

const logoutUser = () => {
  return {
    type: 'LOGOUT'
  }
};

A common practice when working with Redux is to assign action types as read-only constants, then reference these constants wherever they are used. You can refactor the code you're working with to write the action types as const declarations.
e.g 
const LOGIN = 'LOGIN';
const LOGOUT = 'LOGOUT';

const defaultState = {
  authenticated: false
};

const authReducer = (state = defaultState, action) => {

  switch (action.type) {

    case LOGIN:
      return {
        authenticated: true
      }

    case LOGOUT:
      return {
        authenticated: false
      }
    default:
      return state;
  }
};
const store = Redux.createStore(authReducer);

const loginUser = () => {
  return {
    type: LOGIN
  }
};
const logoutUser = () => {
  return {
    type: LOGOUT
  }
};

Another method you have access to on the Redux store object is store.subscribe(). This allows you to subscribe listener functions to the store, which are called whenever an action is dispatched against the store. One simple use for this method is to subscribe a function to your store that simply logs a message every time an action is received and the store is updated.

e.g Write a callback function that increments the global variable count every time the store receives an action, and pass this function in to the store.subscribe() method. You'll see that store.dispatch() is called three times in a row, each time directly passing in an action object. Watch the console output between the action dispatches to see the updates take place:

const ADD = 'ADD';

const reducer = (state = 0, action) => {
  switch(action.type) {
    case ADD:
      return state + 1;
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

const store = Redux.createStore(reducer);

// Global count variable:
let count = 0;

// Change code below this line
const incrementCount = () => (count += 1);
store.subscribe(incrementCount)
// Change code above this line

store.dispatch({type: ADD});
console.log(count);
store.dispatch({type: ADD});
console.log(count);
store.dispatch({type: ADD});
console.log(count);

# Conclusion
I am going to continue with redux for now.
