# Introduction
Today we had a health and wellness workshop.

# Body
I learnt a lot from todays workshop.The subtopics that stood out the most for me was the physical well-being.I have been struggling to sleeep to a point where I have to use medicine to sleep.We were given some tips on what we can use to get better sleep.Some of the things that we can use are : chamomile tea,CBD tea, reading, and listining to music.

The other subtopic was the emotional well-being.I have beeen struggling to show my emotions because I've been wanting to protect other people.I have to work on showing my emotions instead of bottling everything.

The other subtopic was the social well-being.I also thing I need to improve on that.

# Conclusion
I am going yo continue with freecode camp.
