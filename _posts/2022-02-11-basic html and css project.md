to me, Lehlogonolo, justmondlisok

1. Create a new repository (CSS & media queries).
2. clone your repo to your local machine using ubuntu terminal.
3. Your app is based on CSS and media queries (using flex/ flexbox/ grid layout.


Your app should contain a heading, two images, and two paragraphs.

On a bigger screen, your images and paragraphs should be displayed as flex or rows.
and on smaller screens,  your images and paragraphs should be displayed as a single grid/columns layout.

Below is the link of what I managed to do :

From this project I was able to see where I am still struggling and also to see what I have learnt so far.I going to continue with Java SCript and go back to html and css to try and master everything that I am struggling with.
