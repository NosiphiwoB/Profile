# Introduction
Today I was busy with the To do list project.

# Body
We were given a project to create a To do list with the following :
1) A form with 3 inputs (subject, description and date) and a submit button.

2)After clicking a submit button the inputs should appear in the table with the functioning Edit and Delete button.

3)When clicking on the Edit button there should be another form where you can edit your input values and a submit button.

4)New values should appear on the table (replacing the old values).

5)Also a delete button should delete.

Here is a link for my to do list project :
