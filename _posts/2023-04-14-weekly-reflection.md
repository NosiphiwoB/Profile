The week was hectic
. I had a lot of to do, as I was preparing for the PL200 exam.


This week I managed to :

- Prepare for the PL200 exam using the MeasureUp practise test.

- I also watched some youtube tutorials (PL200).

- I also did some PL200 tasks on the Labs.


Next week I want to prepare for my second exam :

- I am going to re-do the practise.

- I am going to continue with the labs.


I am struggling with managing  a data model, Power BI in power platform, and managing business flow. For next I want to focus on that.
